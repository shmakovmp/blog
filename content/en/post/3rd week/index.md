## Nothing to tell

So, this week i did what i usually do: went to uni, did my homework and tried not to overlay deadlines. Usual stuff. But this time something really cool happend. Me and my dad ordered new ssd, keyboard and accumulator for my laptop which is dying btw and also my sister won 1st place in swimming tournament. We celebrated it with sushi.
I am excited to upgrade my laptop! Thanks for reading. That's it for now, bye.
